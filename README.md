# Rebuilding turbo-rails tutorial

This is the source code for [the rebuilding turbo-rails tutorial][tutorial]. Each commit corresponds to one video of the course, so it's easy for you to follow along.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Learn to create Rails engines from scratch thanks  to the `rails plugin new` command
- Rebuild together all the backend [turbo-rails][turbo_rails] features
- Learn how to test our engine both manually and with automated tests thanks to the `test/dummy` Rails application
- Learn how to create installation rake tasks thanks to Rails templates
- Test our finalized engine in a real Ruby on Rails application

By the end of the tutorial, you will understand in-depth how [turbo-rails][turbo_rails] works under the hood and even be able to contribute to it yourself! You will also be able to create your own extensions to the Ruby on Rails framework.

All the knowledge we will learn together applies to other Rails engines such as `ActionText` or `ActiveStorage`, for example.

It will also teach you how to read the source code of a gem to understand it when the documentation is scarce.

Let's [get started][tutorial]!
